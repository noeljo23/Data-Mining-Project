BOOK DESCRIPTION

You don't have to be a computer scientist to get involved in the discussion about where artificial intelligence and technology are going.

What will the year 2084 hold for you––for your friends, for your family, and for our society? Are we doomed to the grim dystopia imagined in George Orwell’s 1984?

In 2084, scientist and philosopher John Lennox will introduce you to a kaleidoscope of ideas: the key developments in technological enhancement, bioengineering, and, in particular, artificial intelligence. You will discover the current capacity of AI, its advantages and disadvantages, the facts and the fiction, as well as potential future implications.

The questions posed by AI are open to all of us. And they demand answers. An audiobook that is written to challenge all listeners, no matter your worldview, 2084 shows how the Christian worldview, properly understood, can provide evidence–based, credible answers that will bring you real hope for the future of humanity.

Welcome to the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence, or AI.

If you're curious about what AI is and how it impacts our lives, you're in the right place.

Stick around, and let's explore together!

Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of intelligent behavior.

In simpler terms, it's about making computers think and learn like humans.

These smart machines can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, and language understanding.

Now, let's talk about the advantages of AI.

There are many ways AI positively influences our lives. AI helps automate repetitive tasks, saving time and resources. For example, in manufacturing, robots powered by AI can assemble products much faster than humans. AI aids in medical research, helping to discover new treatments and diagnose diseases more accurately. This contributes to advancements in healthcare and saves lives. AI-driven language translation tools make it easier to communicate across different languages, breaking down language barriers. AI-powered personal assistants, like Siri or Google Assistant, make our daily lives more convenient by providing information, setting reminders, and helping with tasks.

While AI brings many benefits, it also comes with challenges. Let's explore the disadvantages.

Automation through AI can lead to job loss in certain industries. Machines might replace some tasks traditionally done by humans, affecting employment. The collection and use of personal information can raise privacy concerns, as it may lead to the misuse of sensitive data. As we rely more on AI, there's a risk of becoming too dependent on technology. This dependence can make us vulnerable if the systems fail or are misused. AI systems may inherit biases from their creators or the data they learn from, leading to unfair decisions. Ensuring ethical AI practices is crucial to avoiding discrimination.

In conclusion, Artificial Intelligence is a powerful force shaping our world. Understanding its advantages and disadvantages is essential as we navigate this ever-evolving landscape. Whether it's making our lives more efficient or posing challenges, AI is a topic that will continue to shape our future.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/11Csu1K_2iU/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/11Csu1K_2iU/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/11Csu1K_2iU/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/11Csu1K_2iU/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/11Csu1K_2iU/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,ESL Zone,22,none,B1 English Listening Practice: Artificial Intelligence,"#englishlistening #englishlisteningpractice #englishlearning

And Artificial Intelligence will again steal much of the attention at this year’s CES.
In fact, firms participating at the event couldn’t agree more that the use and control of AI will navigate the future.
Joining us is professor Park Juyong from KAIST.

Good morning.


1. Artificial Intelligence is once again one of highlights at the global tech event.
Why does that mean?
What does it say about AI as a leading future technology?

2. What has caught your attention at this year's CES?
Any particular AI models that our viewers may be interested in?

3. Based on the models that have come out that we've discussed this morning, would you say this year's edition will be a success?

4. There are AI gadgets looking after not just humans but also pets.
Samsung Electronics introduced its AI homekeeper Ballie.
These are all things that we never thought would exist just decades ago.
What kind of AI models do you expect to come out in the near future?

5. The Federation of Korean industries has released its own list of global AI ranking.
South Korea made it to 6th on the list after the U.S., China, Singapore, the UK, and Canada.
What is South Korea lacking in the chase to be an AI leader, and what will it take to overtake the counties that are ahead?

Thanks for your time today.
Have a great day.

AI has been around for decades but the advancement in the past 18-months, powered by the likes of OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, is capturing the attention of corporate leaders around the world.  AI is increasingly finding its way into product design and even non-tech companies are already monetizing new products with embedded AI.

Companies are excited about the prospects AI can offer; at the same time, there are concerns about the elevated risk profile it introduces. Corporate boards are focusing on better understanding the technology and establishing guardrails to ensure risks of information security, data quality, hallucinations, and other areas are appropriately managed. Join the CAQ and NACD for a webinar to learn about what AI is and isn’t, examples of how businesses are using the technologies that encompass it in financial reporting, and what questions boards should ask of corporate management.

Time: 1pm – 2pm
Venue: Academic Conference Room, 11/F Cheng Yu Tung Tower, The University of Hong Kong

Speaker: Dr. Konrad Borowicz (Assistant Professor, Tilburg Institute for Law, Technology, and Society, Tilburg University)

As the financial industry seeks to leverage the strengths of artificial intelligence (AI), it must confront the data quality problem. AI applications demand substantial volumes of both training and testing data, posing significant challenges not only in terms of data availability but also with respect to its quality. Open finance initiatives focus on the former but not the latter. AI regulations are likely to impose strict but general data quality requirements prompting the question how the financial industry will meet them. While some private initiatives aimed at addressing the problem are ongoing, major issues in areas such as data structuring, compensation, liability, and dispute resolution are likely to remain unaddressed. This paper proposes a menu of public policy options designed to address the data quality problem inspired by data quality regulations in various sectors. These options range from providing guidance regarding financial data quality, mandating the setting of data quality standards by private data sharing schemes to public management of data pools certified to meet such standards.

Dr. Konrad Borowicz is an Assistant Professor of Financial Regulation and Technology at the Tilburg Institute of Law, Technology and Society at Tilburg Law School, Tilburg University in the Netherlands. He is also a Research Coordinator of Tilburg Law and Economics Center based at the Tilburg School of Economics and Management. In his research, he looks at the regulation of credit and data, mainly from a law and economics perspective. His work has appeared in the Journal of Financial Regulation, the Capital Markets Law Journal, Law and Financial Markets Review, Review of Banking and Financial Law, among other publications. He is also a co-editor of a volume “Evolution of Transnational Rule Makers through Crises” recently published with Cambridge University Press. Prior to joining Tilburg University, Dr. Borowicz worked as a finance lawyer in London. He obtained his JSD from Columbia Law School, PhD from the European University Institute, LLM from Duke Law School and his first law degree from Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan, Poland.

Full Title: Practical Application of Artificial Intelligence Models in Mitosis Scoring

Abstract: The implementation of AI in clinical practice needs to be critically evaluated against the existing methods. We aimed at assessing the optimal method of using AI-based mitotic figure scoring in breast cancer (BC). Utilizing whole slide images from a large Nottingham BC cohort (discovery n=1715, validation n=859) and TCGA-BRCA external test set (n=757), automated mitosis detection was applied using three methods: mitotic count per tumour area (MCT), mitotic index (MI), and mitotic activity index (MAI). The study compares these AI-based metrics with the Nottingham grading system (NGS), Ki67 score, clinicopathological parameters, and patient outcomes. While all three AI methods (MCT, MI, and MAI) significantly correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and patient survival, MAI and MCT show positive correlations with the gold standard visual scoring in NGS (r=0.8 and r=0.7, respectively) and Ki67 score (r=0.69 and r=0.55, respectively). MAI emerges as the sole independent predictor of survival in multivariate Cox regression analysis. The findings emphasize the need to consider the optimal AI-based scoring method for clinical applications, highlighting MAI as a reliable and reproducible approach for accurate mitotic figure quantification in BC.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IWaB1_Ge1EI/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IWaB1_Ge1EI/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IWaB1_Ge1EI/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,,,,,,,TIA Warwick,28,none,"Practical Application of Artificial Intelligence Models in Mitosis Scoring: Asmaa Ibrahim, 22/01/24","TIA Centre Seminar Series: Dr. Asmaa Ibrahim

Title: Reliability of Artificial Intelligence: Chances and Challenges

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is currently leading to one breakthrough after the other, both in public life with, for instance, autonomous driving and speech recognition, and in the sciences in areas such as medical imaging or molecular dynamics. However, one current major drawback worldwide, in particular, in light of regulations such as the EU AI Act and the G7 Hiroshima AI Process, is the lack of reliability of such methodologies.
In this talk, we will provide an introduction into this vibrant research area, focussing specifically on deep neural networks. We will discuss the role of a theoretical perspective to this highly topical research direction, and survey the current state of the art in areas such as explainability. Finally, we will also touch upon fundamental limitations of neural network-based approaches.

Gitta Kutyniok (https://www.ai.math.lmu.de/kutyniok) currently has a Bavarian AI Chair for Mathematical Foundations of Artificial Intelligence at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. She received her Diploma in Mathematics and Computer Science as well as her Ph.D. degree from the Universität Paderborn in Germany, and her Habilitation in Mathematics in 2006 at the Justus-Liebig Universität Gießen. From 2001 to 2008 she held visiting positions at several US institutions, including Princeton University, Stanford University, Yale University, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Washington University in St. Louis. In 2008, she became a full professor of mathematics at the Universität Osnabrück, and moved to Berlin three years later, where she held an Einstein Chair in the Institute of Mathematics at the Technische Universität Berlin and a courtesy appointment in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering until 2020. In addition, Gitta Kutyniok held an Adjunct Professorship in Machine Learning at the University of Tromso from 2019 until 2023. 
Gitta Kutyniok has received various awards for her research such as an award from the Universität Paderborn in 2003, the Research Prize of the Justus-Liebig Universität Gießen and a Heisenberg-Fellowship in 2006, and the von Kaven Prize by the DFG in 2007. She was invited as the Noether Lecturer at the ÖMG-DMV Congress in 2013, a plenary lecturer at the 8th European Congress of Mathematics (8ECM) in 2021, and the lecturer of the London Mathematical Society (LMS) Invited Lecture Series in 2022. She was also honored by invited lectures at both the International Congress of Mathematicians 2022 (ICM 2022) and the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 2023). Moreover, she was elected as a member of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 2017 and of the European Academy of Sciences in 2022, and became a SIAM Fellow in 2019 and an IEEE Fellow in 2024. She currently acts as LMU-Director of the Konrad Zuse School of Excellence in Reliable AI (relAI) in Munich, serves as Vice President-at-Large of SIAM, and is spokesperson of the DFG-Priority Program ""Theoretical Foundations of Deep Learning"" and of the AI-HUB@LMU, which is the interdisciplinary platform for research and teaching in AI and data science at LMU.

BOOK DESCRIPTION

One of America's top doctors reveals how AI will empower physicians and revolutionize patient care Medicine has become inhuman, to disastrous effect. The doctor-patient relationship--the heart of medicine--is broken: doctors are too distracted and overwhelmed to truly connect with their patients, and medical errors and misdiagnoses abound. In Deep Medicine, leading physician Eric Topol reveals how artificial intelligence can help. AI has the potential to transform everything doctors do, from notetaking and medical scans to diagnosis and treatment, greatly cutting down the cost of medicine and reducing human mortality. By freeing physicians from the tasks that interfere with human connection, AI will create space for the real healing that takes place between a doctor who can listen and a patient who needs to be heard. Innovative, provocative, and hopeful, Deep Medicine shows us how the awesome power of AI can make medicine better, for all the humans involved.

BOOK DESCRIPTION

Two leaders in the field offer a compelling analysis of the current state of the art and reveal the steps we must take to achieve a truly robust artificial intelligence.

Despite the hype surrounding AI, creating an intelligence that rivals or exceeds human levels is far more complicated than we have been led to believe. Professors Gary Marcus and Ernest Davis have spent their careers at the forefront of AI research and have witnessed some of the greatest milestones in the field, but they argue that a computer beating a human in Jeopardy! does not signal that we are on the doorstep of fully autonomous cars or superintelligent machines. The achievements in the field thus far have occurred in closed systems with fixed sets of rules, and these approaches are too narrow to achieve genuine intelligence. 

The real world, in contrast, is wildly complex and open-ended. How can we bridge this gap? What will the consequences be when we do? Taking inspiration from the human mind, Marcus and Davis explain what we need to advance AI to the next level, and suggest that if we are wise along the way, we won't need to worry about a future of machine overlords. If we focus on endowing machines with common sense and deep understanding, rather than simply focusing on statistical analysis and gatherine ever larger collections of data, we will be able to create an AI we can trust—in our homes, our cars, and our doctors' offices. Rebooting AI provides a lucid, clear-eyed assessment of the current science and offers an inspiring vision of how a new generation of AI can make our lives better.

While AI can have many positive applications in various fields, it can also be used for harmful purposes if misused or weaponized. Here are some areas where AI can be weaponized:

Autonomous Weapons: AI-powered autonomous weapons, also known as ""killer robots,"" are a significant concern. These are weapons systems that can identify and engage targets without human intervention. The potential for misuse or accidental harm makes this a highly controversial area.
Cyberattacks: AI can be used to develop sophisticated cyberattack tools, including malware and ransomware. AI can enhance the speed and effectiveness of cyberattacks, making it more challenging to defend against them.
Deepfakes: AI can be used to create highly convincing deepfake videos and audio recordings that can be used for disinformation campaigns, blackmail, or impersonation.
Social Media Manipulation: AI algorithms can be employed to manipulate social media platforms by spreading fake news, disinformation, or creating divisive content to influence public opinion or sow discord.
Surveillance: AI-powered surveillance systems can be used for mass surveillance, violating privacy rights and enabling tracking and profiling of individuals.
Autonomous Vehicles as Weapons: Autonomous vehicles equipped with AI could potentially be used as weapons if hacked or repurposed for malicious intent.
Drone Warfare: AI can be used to enhance the capabilities of military drones, making them more lethal and autonomous in their operations.
Biased Decision-Making: If AI algorithms used in defense and security applications are biased or flawed, they can lead to discriminatory or unjust actions.
Predictive Policing: AI systems that predict criminal behavior could be used inappropriately, leading to profiling or targeting of specific communities.
Surveillance Capitalism: AI can be used for invasive data collection and analysis by corporations or governments, compromising individual privacy and potentially leading to surveillance-based control.
To prevent the weaponization of AI, there are ongoing international efforts to establish ethical guidelines and regulations. Organizations, researchers, and policymakers are working together to ensure responsible AI development and use, while also addressing security concerns. It is crucial to strike a balance between harnessing AI's potential benefits and mitigating the risks associated with its misuse.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Br8EqeGe_c/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Br8EqeGe_c/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Br8EqeGe_c/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Br8EqeGe_c/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2Br8EqeGe_c/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,DailyDoseOfDrive,22,none,Elon Musk - Weaponization of artificial intelligence (AI),"The weaponization of artificial intelligence (AI) raises ethical, legal, and security concerns.

BOOK DESCRIPTION

This program includes an introduction read by the author.

No recent scientific enterprise has proved as alluring, terrifying, and filled with extravagant promise and frustrating setbacks as artificial intelligence. The award-winning author Melanie Mitchell, a leading computer scientist, now reveals its turbulent history and the recent surge of apparent successes, grand hopes, and emerging fears that surround AI.

In Artificial Intelligence, Mitchell turns to the most urgent questions concerning AI today: How intelligent—really—are the best AI programs? How do they work? What can they actually do, and when do they fail? How humanlike do we expect them to become, and how soon do we need to worry about them surpassing us? Along the way, she introduces the dominant methods of modern AI and machine learning, describing cutting-edge AI programs, their human inventors, and the historical lines of thought that led to recent achievements. She meets with fellow experts like Douglas Hofstadter, the cognitive scientist and Pulitzer Prize–winning author of the modern classic Gödel, Escher, Bach, who explains why he is “terrified” about the future of AI. She explores the profound disconnect between the hype and the actual achievements in AI, providing a clear sense of what the field has accomplished and how much farther it has to go.

Interweaving stories about the science and the people behind it, Artificial Intelligence brims with clear-sighted, captivating, and approachable accounts of the most interesting and provocative modern work in AI, flavored with Mitchell’s humor and personal observations. This frank, lively book will prove an indispensable guide to understanding today’s AI, its quest for “human-level” intelligence, and its impacts on all of our futures.

The plane here uses the countermeasure defence system that deploys the flairs to avoid detection from heat-seeking missiles. 
Russia has started installing this technology in their missiles and it has proved to be the next level of development in weapon technology.
Whenever any missile comes close to another missile then to make it confused, this missile deploys the flairs.
It has been specially designed to fight like an iron dome defence system. 
The Russians have named this missile as the KH 101 cruise missile. 
Also, the different types of warheads can be loaded in this.

Use this vocabulary for English conversation on AI so you can fully participate in discussions and feel great doing so.

If, like me, you've noticed everyone talking about Artificial Intelligence — it's pros and cons, the hopes and fears — but felt unsure about what to say, I'm going to help.

This lesson is focused on the vocabulary you need to participate in English conversations on AI.

And if this is a new topic for you, that's great! You'll be ready to share your thoughts when someone asks your opinion of AI (hint: I might be asking you that in this lesson).

I'll be honest, I didn't think AI played a big role in my life. But some of my loved ones and some of my friends were talking about it nonstop.

I wanted to be part of those conversations. As I continued to learn and understand the key vocabulary and concepts, I realized how much I use Artificial Intelligence every day.

I want you to feel equally comfortable and confident in English conversation with your friends, loved ones, and coworkers.

📖What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

አርቲፊሻል ኢንተለጀንስ ወይም በአማርኛ - ሰው ሰራሽ አስተውሎት ልንለው እንችላለን። እናም በ1950ዎቹ በኮምፒውተር ሳይንቲስቶች እንደ አንድ የጥናት ዘርፍ (field) የተመሰረት ነው።

📌The father of Artificial Intelligence, John McCarthy, እንደሚከተለው ትርጉሙን አስቀምጧል፦

   ""AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.""

  ከዚህ በፊት በተለያየ አጋጣሚ ""አርቲፊሻል ኢንተለጀንስ"" ሲባል ሰምታችሁ ይሆናል። ቀለል ባለ መንገድ ስንፈታው ""የሰው ልጅ እንደሚያስበው የሚያስቡ፥ የሰው ልጅ እንደሚሰራው፣ እንደሚወስነው የሚሰሩና የሚወስኑ፥ እንደ ሰው ልጅ ችግር ፈቺ ሊሆኑ የሚችሉ ሮቦቶችን, ኮምፒዩተሮችን መፍጠር ነው።""

📝የቃሉንም ትርጉም ስናየው፦

    🪄""Artificial"" ማለት ""man made"" - ሰው ሰራሽ ማለት ነው።
   🪄""Intelligence"" ማለት ደግሞ ""thinking power or the ability to learn and solve problems"" - የማሰብ ችሎታ ማለት ነው።

ስለዚህ ""AI means Man-made thinking power.""

በተጨማሪም መርዳት ያለብን ነገር ""Intelligence"" ሲባል ብዙ ነገሮችን (የሚከተሉትን) በውስጡ ያካተተ ነው።

Would you like to make a voice translation? ElevenLabs can do really voice translation which even sounds like me :)
You can also do a manual dub with your own voice if you prefer. Whatever works best.
1. Check out https://elevenlabs.io/docs/dubbing/studio
2. Make the video & upload it to youtube or somewhere.
3. Make sure the description shows that this is an AI translation, and include a link to the original video.
4. Send a link to me (for example via a comment) and I'll add it above.

You can decide if you want to host it on your youtube channel or if I should host it. 

If you have practical questions you can ask Stefan Kirschnick, he made the German dub and is happy to provide support. https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefankirschnick/",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2IK3DFHRFfw/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2IK3DFHRFfw/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2IK3DFHRFfw/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2IK3DFHRFfw/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2IK3DFHRFfw/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Henrik Kniberg,10,none,Generative AI in a Nutshell - how to survive and thrive in the age of AI,"Basically a full day AI course crammed into 18 mins of drawing & talking.

आजवर तुम्ही कृत्रिम बुद्धिमत्ता या तंत्रज्ञानाबद्दल फक्त ऐकलं असेल. पण आता या तंत्रज्ञानाच्या मदतीनं भारतात नव्हे तर आपल्या महाराष्ट्रातील बारामती येथे शेती केली जात आहे. या तंत्रज्ञानामुळे शेती उत्पन्नात ३० टक्के वाढ होईल, असा दावाही करण्यात येत आहे. मग आता तुम्हाला प्रश्न पडला असेल की, नेमकं तंत्रज्ञान आहे तरी काय? तर कृत्रिम बुद्धिमत्ता म्हणजे काय? त्याचा शेतात कसा वापर केला जातो? तर या सर्व प्रश्नांची उत्तरं देणारा हा खास ग्राऊंड रिपोर्ट पाहूया.

So far you have only heard about artificial intelligence technology. But now with the help of this technology, farming is being done not in India but in Baramati in Maharashtra. It is also claimed that this technology will increase the agricultural income by 30 percent. So now you may be wondering, what is the actual technology? So what is artificial intelligence? How is it used in the field? So let's see this special ground report that answers all these questions.

In November, the Artificial Intelligence SIG of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) published an extensive working document that sets out considerations relevant for developing a library strategic response to Artificial Intelligence. (Please review in advance!)
Andrew will join us to present the document and engage in discussion on potential impacts and implications of Libraries and AI to support strategic responses.
 
The document addresses:

Defining AI: “Definitions of AI typically revolve around the idea of computers performing tasks which are ordinarily undertaken using human intelligence. The UNESCO definition emphasises that this is imitation of human understanding.”

Impact of AI on libraries: AI has the potential to have “wide and deep” impacts on library work.

Strategic context and a library SWOT: In a context of change and uncertainty thinking and acting strategically is seen of increasing importance. Many institutions are placing greater emphasis on strategy, on envisioning a desired future state, and planning to realise this vision. 

For libraries a key issue is to position themselves strongly in relation to wider institutional, sectoral and national priorities. This can be a form of passive alignment, seeking to demonstrate the library’s contribution to the organisational mission, or even proactive in seeking to take a leadership role in certain areas.

Strategic responses to AI: Pros and cons

The strategic responses to AI could include one or a combination of the following broad approaches:
• Recruiting new staff with specialist AI skills
• Upskilling existing staff
• Engaging with users to see how they are using AI
• Studying sector best practice
• Running proof of concept projects
• Talking to the system suppliers and buying systems
• Aligning to what is happening in the institution
• Collaborating with other units

Three important strategies:
• Using library AI capabilities to model responsible and explainable applications of descriptive AI
• Using librarians’ data competencies to enhance organisational AI capability
• Promoting AI literacy to enhance organisational and societal AI capabilities

""How exactly will libraries participate in the AI revolution?"" -Richard Whitt",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RZND8YEq-Jo/default.jpg,120,90,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RZND8YEq-Jo/mqdefault.jpg,320,180,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RZND8YEq-Jo/hqdefault.jpg,480,360,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RZND8YEq-Jo/sddefault.jpg,640.0,480.0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RZND8YEq-Jo/maxresdefault.jpg,1280.0,720.0,Libraries In Response,29,none,Session 84: Developing a Library Strategic Response to Artificial Intelligence,"Generative AI took the world by storm during 2023. In November, the Artificial Intelligence SIG of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) published an extensive working document that sets out considerations relevant for developing a library strategic response to Artificial Intelligence. (Please review in advance!)
Andrew will join us to present the document and engage in discussion on potential impacts and implications of Libraries and AI to support strategic responses.
 
The document addresses:

Defining AI: “Definitions of AI typically revolve around the idea of computers performing tasks which are ordinarily undertaken using human intelligence. The UNESCO definition emphasises that this is imitation of human understanding.”

Impact of AI on libraries: AI has the potential to have “wide and deep” impacts on library work.

Strategic context and a library SWOT: In a context of change and uncertainty thinking and acting strategically is seen of increasing importance. Many institutions are placing greater emphasis on strategy, on envisioning a desired future state, and planning to realise this vision. 

For libraries a key issue is to position themselves strongly in relation to wider institutional, sectoral and national priorities. This can be a form of passive alignment, seeking to demonstrate the library’s contribution to the organisational mission, or even proactive in seeking to take a leadership role in certain areas.

No need to pair it with other devices, but you can connect it to Wi-Fi if you prefer. You charge it with a USB-C port, and Rabbit says it'll last a whole day on one charge.

The R1 is priced at $199, but keep in mind the monthly cellular bill is separate, and you need to set that up on your own. Preorders are available starting today, and it will be shipped in late March.
