1. REF_DATE
What it Represents: The reference date or year (or sometimes quarter) for the data.

Example Value: 2002
This tells you the year for which the data was collected or is valid.

2. GEO
What it Represents: The geographical region that the data pertains to.

Example Value: Canada
This indicates that the statistics are for the entire country of Canada.

3. DGUID (Dissemination Geography Unique Identifier)
What it Represents: A unique code used by Statistics Canada to identify a specific geographic area.

Example Value: 2021A000011124
This code can be used internally or when merging data from other tables that use the same DGUID format.

4. Age group
What it Represents: The particular age bracket or population segment covered by the data.

Example Value: Total, 15 years and over
This means the statistic applies to everyone aged 15 and older, without further subdivision.

5. Gender
What it Represents: The gender breakdown or classification of the persons covered by the statistic.

Example Value: Total, gender of person
Indicates that the data includes all genders (i.e., no separate breakdown by male/female or other categories).

6. Indicators
What it Represents: The specific mental health measure or indicator being reported.

Example Value: Major depressive episode, life
This means the data point corresponds to lifetime prevalence of major depressive episodes (i.e., how many people have had a major depressive episode at any point in their life).

7. Characteristics
What it Represents: Describes the nature of the statistic being measured (often the type of count, rate, or percentage).

Example Value: Number of persons
Tells you that this data is a simple count of individuals (not a rate, not a percentage).

8. UOM (Unit of Measure)
What it Represents: The unit or scale in which the data is being expressed.

Example Value: Number
Indicates that the statistic is measured in “number of persons,” i.e., a raw count.

9. UOM_ID
What it Represents: An internal numeric code used by Statistics Canada or the data provider to represent the unit of measure.

Example Value: 223
This code ties “Number” to a specific internal reference.

10. SCALAR_FACTOR
What it Represents: The multiplier or divisor needed to interpret the value (e.g., “units,” “thousands,” “millions”).

Example Value: units
If it said “thousands,” you would multiply the value by 1,000. Here, “units” means no scaling factor is applied (the data is already in “raw units”).

11. SCALAR_ID
What it Represents: A numeric code for the scalar factor.

Example Value: 0
This code internally indicates the type of scalar factor (“units,” in this case).

12. VECTOR
What it Represents: A unique series identifier used by Statistics Canada’s data tables to differentiate one particular data series from others.

Example Value: v73953257
If you are downloading multiple indicators or time points, this code helps you identify which series the row belongs to.

13. COORDINATE
What it Represents: The dimensional coordinate in a multi-dimensional data table. Statistics Canada often structures data in “cubes,” where COORDINATE positions help locate the precise cell in that cube.

Example Value: 1.1.1.5.1
Each digit or sub-digit typically corresponds to a different dimension (e.g., time, geography, indicator, etc.), enabling you to trace the data point in a pivoted or multidimensional format.

14. VALUE
What it Represents: The numerical value of the data being measured.

Example Value: 3037049
Indicates that 3,037,049 persons (age 15+) in Canada reported having experienced a major depressive episode in their lifetime for the year 2002. (This is a hypothetical example interpretation based on the snippet.)

15. STATUS
What it Represents: The status of the data point (e.g., whether it is preliminary, final, or revised).

Example Value: (empty in your example)
Typically, you might see codes like “F” (final), “P” (preliminary), or “R” (revised). If empty, it may indicate “final” or “no special status.”

16. SYMBOL
What it Represents: This field may display special symbols (e.g., “E” for “use with caution,” “F” for “too unreliable to be published,” etc.).

Example Value: (empty in your example)
An empty cell means there is no special caution or data note.

17. TERMINATED
What it Represents: Indicates if the data series is terminated/archived.

Example Value: (empty in your example)
Means the series is likely still ongoing or not flagged as ended.

18. DECIMALS
What it Represents: The number of decimal places for the numeric values.

Example Value: 0
Means the value is an integer (no decimal portion).
